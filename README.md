(In order of most want to work on to least)

1. Period Tracker

    As a user, I want to be able to reliably track my period and its symptoms.  I want to be able to see trends and the prediciton my upcoming date. As a user, I want to be able to choose which information is important to me and not have to correct assumptions based on who the app has decided is the prototypical user.

    - [Mapi US](http://mapi-us.iterar.co/)   
    - [Infermedica](https://infermedica.com/)

2. Clothing Swap

    As a user I want to be able to post my unwanted clothing and accessories and see available items in my area.  I want to be able to be able to search by location, item, brand and size.  As a buyer I want to be able to message sellers and propose swaps or complete monetary purchases through the site.

    APIS: 
    - [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api)  


3. Typing/Vocab Learning

    As a user, I would like to be able to take typing and vocabulary tests to improve my digital writing skills.  I would like to choose tests topics and difficulties. I would like to learn in an interactive and entertianing way, and challenge my friends to head to head challenges.  As a recurring user, I would like to track my progress and see how I am improving.
